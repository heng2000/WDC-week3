            <h1>A page with some divs and spans</h1>
            <p>This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.</p>
            <pre>Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".
    This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.</pre>
            <hr>
            <p>This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue-span">this span of text is blue </span>and <span class="fancy-span">this span has a font-family of cursive</span>,because they belongs to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, <span class="blue-fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span></p>
        </div>
        <div>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</div>
